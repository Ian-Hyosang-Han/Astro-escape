# Personal Note
- Creating this game was a genuinely joyful experience. As someone who grew up playing classic shooting games, building one myself was both nostalgic and exciting. I had no clear idea how to begin at first, but through a lot of researchâ€”and with the help of AIâ€”I was able to bring this project to life. It took time, but in the end, I created something Iâ€™m truly proud of.
